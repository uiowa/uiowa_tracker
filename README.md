# University of Iowa Tracker Module

This module allows administrators to track specified page (node) visits by authenticated users. This custom module was requested as an alternative to other, more bloated, solutions.

1. Navigate to the Admin Configuration screen found under Home » Administration » Configuration and select 'UIowa Tracker settings' found under the University of Iowa admin menu.

2. Enter the relative path(s) of any nodes that must be tracked and click 'Save configuration'. **NOTE: Do not include leading or trailing slashes.**
  For example:
   - about
   - help
   - path/to/node/node

3. To delete all tracking data from the database, click 'Clear tracking log' under the 'Operations' fieldset and click 'OK' in the confirmation window.
